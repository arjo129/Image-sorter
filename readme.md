# Imagesorter App
This is a UWP (Universal windows platform app) which uses only UWP APIs to sort through large numbers of images and videos.
You can select a folder and root out blurred images.

## Why I built this
I wrote this app upon my return from South Africa. During this trip my family took over 5000 photos and 500 videos. 
So how do you sort through the good ones and bad ones?
This app essentially allows me to individually delete photos and videos that are low quality. It ranks all photos by metrics like blurriness, exposure quality etc.
I can then identify which photos are worth keeping and which are not.
It is the first time that I dealt with UWP and C#. I must say despite all of M$S$ problems, they have put together a very solid developer platform.
